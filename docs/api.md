# API Documentation

The backend API for GeoMind AI is built using FastAPI, which automatically generates interactive OpenAPI documentation.

## Accessing the Documentation

Once the backend server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) by navigating to the `/docs` endpoint in your browser.

**URL**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

This interface allows you to explore the API endpoints, view the request and response models, and even send test requests directly from your browser.

A `openapi.json` file is also available at [http://localhost:8000/openapi.json](http://localhost:8000/openapi.json).
